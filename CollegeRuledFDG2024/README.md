# CollegeRuled
An iteration on earlier works such as James Skorupski's Wide Ruled 2.0. College Ruled is an author-goal driven computational storytelling system that intelligently pathfinds between author-specified waypoints.

## Running the System
- To generate and run an example story, execute the `run.py` file.
- The `events`folder contains all the scripts for unique events that can occur in the story-world we authored, which is loosely based off of planets like Tatooine from Star Wars and Arrakis in Dune.
- The `backbone_classes.py` file contains the basic objects that make up College Ruled, including Plot Fragments, Worldstates and Environments.
- `path_finding.py` contains the scripts related to intelligent pathfinding
